## Description

Adds several rectangular platforms. The blob is drawn as a noisy circle and is followed by a meditative camera experience that scrolls through a world larger than the screen.

Adjustements: For the assignment we were tasked with changing the look and feel of the blob, and to use pacing and motion to evoke emotion. I made it so that the emotion was calm, I adjusted the blob and the screen tracking speed as well as the way it jumps and its gravitational pull to make the blob seem slower. On top of this, I made the colour scheme a calm green palette to further evoke the emotion.
